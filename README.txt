HELL YRAH it's working!!!!💪💪💪
This is genius 😍 My very first project managed with command line!
Bitches!!! Here I come... 🧙🏼‍♀️🧹


Using command line I've:
Created new text file
Created new directory
Moved text file to new directory
Initialized git for directory
Added text file
Eddited text file
Commit that change

Now I'm planning to push those commits to newly created GitHub repo.
Let's see if it works...

...aaaaaaand many mooooore 😜
