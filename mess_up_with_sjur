Can I write anything here? 
Will it be saved?
What if I close it?
Will I find it here again after opening?
So many existential questions...

OMG it worked!!!😍

Damn it's really working!!!😍😍

Ok so what now? When it's a git file??

<<<<<<< HEAD
Oh my dear... Now I'm on my new branch named "branchita" 😂
=======
Gonna do the commit on master branch and then merge branches...
Gosh I'm starting to talk borring coding stuff 🙈
>>>>>>> master

Do I technically need to edit anything to resolve that conflict? Let's seeeeeeee
